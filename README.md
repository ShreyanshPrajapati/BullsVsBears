# Bulls Vs Bears

The golden rule of investment is to never keep all your eggs in one basket. Every investor should park their capital in different asset classes. In todays' era, you don't have to be an institutional investor to invest your money in the global economy, even a retail investor can invest small capital in economies of different countries. Why is it useful? Because economies and stock markets of different countries grow at different rates and we want to maximize our returns and minimize our risk. You can always hedge your investment by investing in a fast growing economy and stable economy. Having said that, how do you know which country's economy will grow and give the best returns? That's what we want to find out. We can check how the country's economy has performed by tracking the index fund of the country. We want to analyze the biggest index funds of 6 different countries to find out how these markets have performed in the last 20 years. Additionally, we want to identify how severely international markets have been affected due to covid-19 pandemic. We also aim to predict the future price of the countryâ€™s index fund to take informed decisions about investments.
